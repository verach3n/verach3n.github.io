  Greetings! I'm a wanderer from the picturesque land of Anhui, China, nestled in the embrace of the mighty Yangtze River. For the first 18 years of my life, I called this province home, soaking in the rich culture and vibrant landscapes.

Fast forward to my college adventures in the bustling city of Nanjing at Southeast University. After a spontaneous detour into the world of electronics, I proudly emerged with a bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Engineering. But the story doesn't stop there! I decided to spice things up by embarking on a 3+2 collaboration between my alma mater and the prestigious KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden.

So, here I am, swapping the warmth of the Yangtze for the cool vibes of the north. In August 2022, I landed in this land of lakes, Vikings, and IKEA furniture, ready to dive into the next chapter of my academic journey.

Join me as I navigate the quirky contrasts between the traditions of the East and the innovations of the West, all while trying to master the art of surviving Swedish winters!
